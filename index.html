  Jamaica is an island country located in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital is Kingston and its population is about 2,890,000. Come see why Errol Flynn, and countless others, have called Jamaica the most beautiful place their eyes have ever seen. Majestic waterfalls, grand rivers and lush landscapes are just the beginning of the journey. 
</p>
<h2>Top Tourist Places To Visit In Jamaica</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Martha Bra River</li><p>Rafting on the Martha Brae, the island’s #1 rafting attraction is located approximately three miles inland from the town of Falmouth, birthplace of one of Jamaica’s former Prime Minister, Hugh Shearer. The attraction is a mere twenty miles from Montego Bay and forty miles from Ocho Rios. The embarkation area, “Rafter’s Village”, encompasses six acres of beautifully manicured lawns situated on a natural horseshoe island. It offers a fully appointed recreational facility which includes picnic grounds, a full service bar, two souvenir shops, swimming pool and modern restrooms. Before embarking on the tour, guests can also take a stroll through “Miss Martha’s Herb Garden”, a presentation of Jamaica’s herbs famous for their medicinal and healing properties. Established more than forty years ago, Rafting on the Martha Brae boasts a complement of eighty five licensed and experienced raft captains. Thirty-foot long bamboo rafts are boarded from a concrete pier, under the supervision of a licensed dispatcher. The raft ride is operated over a three mile stretch of the beautiful Martha Brae River and lasts approximately one hour. Once on the raft, guests can learn about “The Legend of Martha Brae” or enjoy an exhilarating swim. T he attraction has over the years played host to a number of celebrities including HRH Queen Elizabeth II, heavy weight champion Lennox Lewis, Chuck Norris, Dionne Warwick, Spike Lee, former NBA star Patrick Ewing, Jane Seymour of “Doctor Quinn- Medicine Woman” fame, Kenny Rodgers, the late Johnny Cash and world 100 meter champion Usain Bolt. The disembarkation area Known as “Martha’s Rest” houses a souvenir shop, bar, lounge area and restrooms</p>
  <li>Dunns River Falls & Park</li><p>Dunn's River Falls is one of Jamaica's national treasures. Globally, it is as well-known as Reggae and equally stimulating. There are few places where the Arawak name "Xayamaca" - land of rivers and springs - is more apt. The Spaniards called the area "Las Chorreras" - the waterfalls or springs - and it is truly one of the most beautiful spots on the island. A stone's throw from Ocho Rios, one of Jamaica's fastest growing resort centres, Dunn's River Falls is unique. Described as a living and growing phenomenon, it continuously regenerates itself from deposits of travertine rock, the result of precipitation of calcium carbonate from the river, as it flows over the falls. The small dome-shaped cataracts are usually associated with thermal spring activity found in limestone caves. This, combined with its location near to the sea, gives Dunn's River the distinction of being the only one of its kind in the Caribbean, if not the world.</p>
  <li>Rastafari Indigenous Village</li><p>Located just outside Montego Bay, Rastafari Indigenous Village is a living cultural center that offers you an opportunity to experience the Rastafari way of life. Whether you choose a half or full-day tour, you'll have the unique opportunity to connect with Rastafarians, and learn more about their culture and values. You'll be introduced to drum makers who create traditional drums by hand, using techniques that have been passed down through generations. You can tour an organic vegetable and herb garden and learn more about why the Rastafari choose to follow a vegan diet, and what are its benefits. You can then have a meal with the Rastafari, and taste for yourself. A small store offers traditional handicrafts and jewelry. The tour concludes with a performance of traditional drumming and singing in the center of the village.</p>
  <li>Seven Mile Beach</li><p>Seven Mile Beach is a long crescent of coral-sand beach on the western end of Grand Cayman island. Seven Mile Beach is known for its beauty, recently receiving the honor of "The Caribbean's Best Beach" from Caribbean Travel and Life Magazine.</p>
  <li>Blue Hole</li><p>Blue Hole is one of those breathtaking water attractions in Jamaica that’s a favorite for both locals and visitors to the island. It’s a crowd-pleaser that has not been privatized, meaning it’s free to access and you’ll only be paying for your guide which you will discover is well worth the few bucks. It’s close enough to Ocho Rios and awe-inspiring enough for you to make this trip a priority when visiting Jamaica.</p>
  <li>Bob Marley Museum</li><p>The Bob Marley Museum is the former home of the reggae legend. Bob’s home is filled with rich memories and treasured mementos, which seek to preserve the life and accomplishment of this great Jamaican and outstanding musician.

  <li>Treasure Beach</li><p>Travelling on Jamaica’s South Coast, you’ll discover a treasure chest of coves and bays, where the Caribbean meets our sandy and sometimes rocky shores. A mixture of dark and white-sand stretches, rocky coves, fishermen’s enclaves and secluded swimming spots, the South Coast’s shores promise a range of possibilities. A favourite beach community of both locals and visitors alike is Treasure Beach (a spot that surely lives up to its name).

Treasure Beach is a six-mile stretch of coral-coloured and sometimes black sands, private coves and rocky shores. For travellers who want to discover the South Coast’s vibrant local culture and people and are in search of untrodden beaches, a visit to one of Treasure Beach’s main bays – Billy's, Calabash, Fort Charles (also known as Starve Gut) Great and Frenchman’s – is a must.

In Calabash Bay, friendly fishermen dock their brightly painted canoes and unload the day’s catch. Visitors swarm, waiting patiently at beachfront cafes and stands, so they can be first to enjoy it – soon to be seasoned and grilled to perfection. Other uniquely Jamaican dishes, such as curried goat, jerked meat and pumpkin soup are also available at roadside stands at Treasure Beach’s public beaches. All lovely, laid-back stretches are well-suited for swimming, snorkeling, biking, hiking, and of course, the mellow vibes of kicking back in the sun with a cold Red Stripe in hand.</p>
